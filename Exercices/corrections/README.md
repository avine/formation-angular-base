## About the labs

`npm start` and `npm test` serve and test the final lab.

To serve and test the other labs, run the commands `npm run start:XX` and `npm run test:XX` respectively.

Example with the lab 1:

```bash
npm run start:01 # serve lab 1
npm run test:01 # test lab 1
```

The final lab is located in the `/src` folder (main application).
The other labs are located in the `/projects` folder and were generated with the command: `ng generate application XXX`.
