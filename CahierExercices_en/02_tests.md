## TP 2: The Tests

In this second TP, we will write our first unit tests. This TP comes at the very beginning of the training, to give you the opportunity to write new tests for the features that we will implement in the following TPs.

During the initial implementation of the application in the previous TP, all the configuration necessary for the proper execution of the unit tests was automatically performed.

We will check that everything is working properly.

- Run the tests via `@angular/cli` and `karma`

```Shell
ng test
```

After the modifications made in TP1, the first tests generated by `@angular/cli` will fail.

You can take a look at the tests generated by `@angular/cli`. They will be explained in more detail in the following sections.

- Correct the generated tests by replacing the value of the `title` in the assertions by the value you used.
