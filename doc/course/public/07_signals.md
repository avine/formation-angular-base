Notes :
ECMA proposal for signal
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals

If the interns ask how it works before, talk about the Zone.js and of the change detection strategy that Angular has 
always used before the introduction of the signals.



## Signals - Definition

- A signal is a **wrapper around a value** that **notifies interested consumers** when that value changes

- Signals **can contain any value**, from primitives to complex data structures

- You **read a signal**'s value by calling its **getter function**, which allows Angular to **track where the signal is used**

- Signals may be either **writable** or **read-only**

ðŸ˜‰ *Later, we'll talk about a process called **synchronization** to understand when and why you should **use signals rather than raw values** to manage the state of your application...*

Notes :



## Signals - signal

- Use `signal` function to create a writable signal

```ts
import { signal } from '@angular/core';

const count = signal<number>(0);

console.log(count());                 // <-- output: 0

count.set(1);

console.log(count());                 // <-- output: 1

count.update((c) => c + 1);

console.log(count());                 // <-- output: 2
```

Notes :



## Signals - computed

- Use `computed` function to derive signal from other signals

- Re-evaluated only when the signals on which they depend change

- Computed signals are read-only

```ts
import { signal, computed } from '@angular/core';

const count = signal<number>(0);

const isEven = computed(() => count() % 2 === 0);

console.log(isEven());                 // <-- output: true

count.set(1);

console.log(isEven());                 // <-- output: false

count.update((c) => c + 1);

console.log(isEven());                 // <-- output: true
```

Notes :



## Signals - effect

- Use `effect` function to run "side-effect", whenever one or more signal values change

- Re-evaluated only when the signals on which they depend change

- Effect signals run at least once

```ts
import { signal, effect } from '@angular/core';

const count = signal<number>(0);

effect(() => {
  console.log('The current count is: ', count()); // <-- Will output: 0, 1, 2
});

count.set(1);

count.update((c) => c + 1);
```

Notes :



## Signals - Synchronization process 1/3

- The goal of synchronization is to keep the **UI** in sync with the **state** of the application

- This is a very complex process, formerly called **Change detection** and still based today on a third-party library called **Zone.js**

- In other words, for now, Zone.js is responsible for telling Angular when to trigger its change detection process and update the UI to reflect the state of the application

- Understanding Zone.js goes beyond the scope of this training

- However, Angular is moving towards **Zoneless** applications

- In this new era, **signals** will play a crucial role in enabling Angular to know exactly when and which parts of the UI needs to be synchronized

As a rule of thumb
  - if the part of the **state to be rendered in your templates** only **changes through signals**
  - then your app should be **ready to go Zoneless**

Notes :



## Signals - Synchronization process 2/3

- Enabling Zoneless in your application is still an experimental feature

```ts
import {
  ApplicationConfig,
  // provideZoneChangeDetection,
  provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection,
} from '@angular/core';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    // provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),   // <-- Default

    provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection(),               // <-- Zoneless
  ],
};
```

- You also need to remove `"zone.js"` and `"zone.js/testing"` in your angular.json configuration file

- Then you can safely uninstall Zone.js by running the command `npm uninstall zone.js`

Notes :



## Signals - Synchronization process 3/3

ðŸ˜‰ *A deeper understanding of the synchronization process goes beyond the scope of this training*

- In-depth resources: https://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless

Notes :



## Signals - Usage in components

- When a signal changes, Angular will automatically re-render the templates that depend on it

- This process is highly efficient, whether the signal is modified in the component itself or in another part of the application

```ts
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component ({
  selector: 'app-counter-delay',
  template: `<button (click)="increment()">{{ count() }}</button>`
})
export class CounterDelayComponent {
  count = signal(0);

  increment() {
    // Angular will correctly synchronize the UI with the updated signal value,
    // even if the signal mutation occurs asynchronously!
    setTimeout(() => this.count.update((count) => count + 1), 1000);
  }
}
```

Notes :



## Signals - Component input and model

Note that the `input` and `model` functions, mentioned in the chapter on components, are in fact signals.
This design makes communication between components highly reactive.

```ts
import { Component, model, signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component ({
  selector: 'app-counter',
  template: `<button (click)="increment()">{{ count() }}</button>`
})
export class CounterComponent {
  count = model(0);
  increment() { this.count.update((count) => count + 1); }
}

@Component ({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [CounterComponent],
  template: `<app-counter [(count)]="appCount" /> <p>{{ appCount() }}</p>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  appCount = signal(0);
}
```
