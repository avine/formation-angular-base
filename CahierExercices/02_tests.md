## Lab 2: Tests

For this second lab, we will write our first unit tests. Feel free to write unit tests in the following labs.

The configuration has been set during the previous lab when running the command `ng new Application`.

We will now check that everything is working well.

- Run tests thanks to `@angular/cli` that uses `karma`

```shell
ng test
```
Because of the modifications done during the previous lab, tests fail.

- Take a look at the tests generated by `@angular/cli`. Everything will be explained in the following parts of the training. 

- Fix the generated tests by updating the `title` value used in assertions by the value you used.
